_switch_
A software based switch, called a _bridge_. Network devices, called _switches_ are responsible for connecting several network links to each other, creating a local area network.

Conceptually, the major components of a network switch are a set of network ports, a control plane, a forwarding plane, and a MAC learning database. The control plane of a switch is typically used to run the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) [15], that calculates a minimum spanning tree for the local area network, preventing physical loops from crashing the network.

For each unicast destination MAC address, the switch looks up the output port in the MAC database. If an entry is found, the frame is forwarded through the port further into the network. If an entry is not found, the frame is instead flooded from all other network ports in the switch, except the port where the frame was received

The Linux bridging module has two separate configuration interfaces exposed to the user-space of the operating system.
The first, ioctl interface to create and destroy bridges
The second, `sysfs` to tune parameters

_Forwarding database_
The forwarding database is an array of 256 elements, where each element is a singly linked list holding the forwarding table entries for the hash value. Unused entries in the forwarding table are cleaned up periodically by the br_cleanup function, that is invoked by
the garbage collection timer.

_Internet Key Exchange (IKE)_
It is a network security protocol designed to dynamically exchange encryption keys and find a way over Security Association (SA) between 2 devices. The Security Association (SA) establishes shared security attributes between 2 network entities to support secure communication. The Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) and Internet Security Association which provides a framework for authentication and key exchange. ISAKMP tells how the set up of the Security Associations (SAs) and how direct connections between two hosts that are using IPsec.

Internet Key Exchange provides message content protection and also an open frame for implementing standard algorithms such as SHA and MD5. The algorithmâ€™s IP sec users produces a unique identifier for each packet. This identifier then allows a device to determine whether a packet has been correct or not
