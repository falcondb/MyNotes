- Pipeline Depth
  - A modern microprocessor has about 15–20 stages
  - The Fetch and Decode cycle typically have 6–10 stages, collectively these are called the _frontend_ of the microprocessor.
  - The Execute and Write back have also grown roughly into 6 to 10 stages. These are called the _backend_ of the microprocessor.
