* [Intel’s CPU roadmap: Aggressive tech advances spur power efficiency](https://www.pcworld.com/article/615594/intel-updates-cpu-roadmap-emphasizing-low-power-cpus.html)

- Low power is now a growing focus in the chip industry, with rival AMD making it a priority with the Ryzen 6000 Mobile chip. Arm chips have always focused on power efficiency.

- According to Kelleher, Alder Lake improves 10 percent in terms of performance per watt.

- Meteor Lake, the first chip manufactured on the Intel 4 technology, and the first use of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) technology by Intel, seen as a necessary step toward next-generation manufacturing technologies. will offer a further 20 percent improvement in performance per watt.

- In the first half of 2024, a PC processor will begin using Intel’s 20A process, the first process of the “Angstrom era.” Here, Intel expects the chip will offer an additional 15 percent in terms of performance per watt, versus the prior generation.

- Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger has said that he intends that Intel will remain the steward of Moore’s Law, the axiom that transistor counts double every 18 months.  Gelsinger said he believes that Intel can achieve putting 1 trillion transistors on a chip package by 2030.
